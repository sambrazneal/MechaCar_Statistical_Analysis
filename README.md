### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A multiple linear regression was performed to analyze which

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance are the ground clearance and vehicle length. These variables p-values were    smaller than the significant value which means that their contribution was not random. 

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  The slope of the linear model is not zero. The linear regression shows that some of the independent variables positively effected the dependent variable. This causes the slope to be greater than zero. 
  
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  For predictability, we will analyze the r-squared value. Since the r-squared value is 0.7149, which means out of 100 cases, this model could predict the mpg correctly about 71 times. Therefore, we can consider this module to be effective.
